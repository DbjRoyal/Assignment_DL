The work reported here aims to map major crop types and LU/LC within the JECAM Site of Nepal. The mapping was performed based on in-situ crop type data collected for the year 2021 and 2022 using Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) approach. Based on the in-situ / reference data, a U-Net model was run for making a crop type map for the year over which the data was collected.
